## Questions posed by dataset uploader:
1. A total number of players in each division, usage of each class in descending order.
2. Some of the players streaming their game (twitch colum). Do they play better than people, who does not?
3. Predict chance to be at top 30 in each division, if we are Necromancer. With and without stream.
4. Average number of finished challanges for each division, show division with highest and lowest average challanges.
5. Show dependency between level and class of died characters. Only for HC divisions.

These questions are answered in the jupyter notebook: poe-analytics.ipynb
